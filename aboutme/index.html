Working with Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Departments of Transportation, transit and highway operators, he relies on his strong scientific background to forge the tools that shape the present and future of transport planning.</p> <h2 id="work-experience"><a href="#work-experience" class="header-anchor">#</a> Work Experience</h2> <h3 id="product-manager-bentley-systems-montreal-since-march-2021"><a href="#product-manager-bentley-systems-montreal-since-march-2021" class="header-anchor">#</a> Product Manager, Bentley Systems, Montreal, since March 2021</h3> <ul><li>As a product expert, Antoine advocates for the products at international conferences, he regularly demonstrates product capabilities live and on-call, helps with qualifying new contacts and onboarding new users.</li> <li>As a subject matter expert with domain market knowledge, Antoine contributes to building the strategy for EMME, CUBE, and DYNAMEQ.</li> <li>Antoine heads the discovery efforts for major new initiatives, including user-interviews, train-the-trainer activities, user shadowing. All of which contributes to de-risk and test hypotheses. He documents findings and spread the knowledge to help build a common understanding of the problems at hand.</li> <li>Antoine led both the discovery and the delivery of Flow, a code-free automation platform designed to improve EMME users productivity. Flow was adopted within the first 6 months of its release by various important organizations around the world (Jacobs, Transport for London, TrafikVerket, DREAL Nord de France). Flow also increased EMME stickiness in transport planning organizations.</li> <li>Antoine prioritizes the documentation efforts in alignment with the Mobility Simulation release targets for EMME, AGENT and DYNAMEQ, and manages the technical writing team.</li> <li>Antoine helps the Mobility Simulation team transition from a 35-person company to a 6000 persons company during the acquisition of INRO Software by Bentley Systems. This involves quickly developing working relationships with Application Security, Release Services, Marketing, Licensing, Sales, and User Success, build clarity, drive alignment and sheperd the business along to avoid user churn and maintain a strong culture of innovation.</li></ul> <h3 id="senior-solutions-analyst-inro-software-montreal-2016-2021"><a href="#senior-solutions-analyst-inro-software-montreal-2016-2021" class="header-anchor">#</a> Senior Solutions Analyst, INRO Software, Montreal, 2016-2021</h3> <ul><li>As a transport planning expert, Antoine led the development of or contributed to several transport models around the world using EMME - Multimodal Planning Software, including  San Diego, London, Sweden, Wellington, Nord de France, Vancouver etc. The latest model he built is Quebec City, Canada (&gt; 100 000CAD). The model was used to forecast transit ridership on a tramway line development project, including a focus on modelling park-and-ride demand to adjust parking lot capacity.</li> <li>Antoine provided in-person and online training for the software EMME and CityPhi. He also contributed to the course content creation and wrote a series of Data Visualization Masterclasses.</li> <li>Antoine was the main developer behind the delivery of Scenes - 3D visualization platform for transport models. By using the CityPhi platform and a Python + Vue.js framework, he built a simple to use application to render EMME model results. The Scenes application is regularly extended to include new visualization and proves a very valuable tool to communicate a shared visual identit y of the Mobility Simulation products.</li> <li>Antoine is the owner and core developer for all functionalities based on map-matching. Map-matching has been used to automated the import of transit schedule information from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) onto a modelling network with resounding success as users have thoroughly tested and confirmed its validity and started to use it with no human in the loop, saving thousands of man-hours every year.</li> <li>Antoine took pride in providing testing frameworks, documentation and support to his colleagues to further the team development practice. All of which was instrumental in the transition of EMME from Python 2 to Python 3.</li></ul> <h2 id="education"><a href="#education" class="header-anchor">#</a> Education</h2> <h3 id="m-a-sc-civil-engineering-polytechnique-montreal-2014-2016"><a href="#m-a-sc-civil-engineering-polytechnique-montreal-2014-2016" class="header-anchor">#</a> M. A. Sc. Civil Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, 2014-2016</h3> <ul><li>Research thesis: <em>Activity based approach to estimation of dynamic origin destination matrix using smartcard data</em>. The project’s goal was to provide a better understanding of public transit user’s demographics and behaviour with the help of data science, behavioural science and a good understanding of intelligent transportation systems. It won an Award for excellence from the CIRRELT (Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherche sur les Réseaux d’Entreprise la Logistique et le Transport). The thesis was presented at the 16th TRISTAN symposium (June 2016) and at the 51st AQTr yearly congress (April 2016).</li> <li>Organized international weekly meetups for researchers interested in the topic of transit smartcard data. The meetups lasted 1 year with a peak attendance of 15 members from ENTPE (Lyon), Polytechnique Montreal and Santiago du Chile University, all three universities were leading on the topic of transit smartcard data.</li></ul> <h3 id="diplome-d-ingenieur-centrale-lyon-2011-2014"><a href="#diplome-d-ingenieur-centrale-lyon-2011-2014" class="header-anchor">#</a> Diplôme d'ingénieur, Centrale Lyon, 2011-2014</h3> <ul><li>Centrale Lyon is consistently one of the top French engineering school.</li> <li>It provides a very broad curriculum designed to give trained engineers the tools to manage and handle complex technology projects.</li> <li>As part of the International Bureau (a team of 15 students), Antoine volunteered to welcome foreign students on campus. He was in charge of helping them with setting up their lives in Lyon: solving housing issues, filing for monetary assitance, opening bank accounts and phone plans. He also contributed to organize and animate a week-long series of welcome events.</li></ul> <h3 id="mpsi-mp-prepa-henri-poincare-nancy-france-2009-2011"><a href="#mpsi-mp-prepa-henri-poincare-nancy-france-2009-2011" class="header-anchor">#</a> MPSI-MP*, Prépa Henri Poincaré, Nancy, France, 2009-2011</h3> <ul><li>Highly selective mathematics and physics curriculum.</li></ul> <h2 id="skills"><a href="#skills" class="header-anchor">#</a> Skills</h2> <ul><li>Product mindset: identify and assess risks as early as possible using product discovery activities such as user-interviews, Minimum Viable Prototype, user commitments techniques etc. Avoid unsuccessful features and focus on building the ones that matter.</li> <li>Public speaking and demonstration: Present regularly our products and methods at conferences (Transport Research Board Annual Meeting and AppCon, European Transport Conference, etc), user meetings and prospect demos.Strong mobility domain knowledge with regular participation to conferences, user meetings etc.</li> <li>Data science and mathematics: statistics, Bayesian stats, graph theory, econometrics, operational research, geometry.</li> <li>Software engineering: Oriented Object Programing, information theory, testing frameworks, DevOps (Github, Azure DevOps), Doc Ops.</li> <li>Language: Python and Javascript/HTML/CSS experience: scientific programing with Pandas and CityPhi, application development with Vue.js.</li> <li>French (native) and English (fluent).</li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last updated:</span> <span class="time">2/21/2023, 10:59:33 PM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

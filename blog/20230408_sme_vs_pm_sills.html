The first waves of &quot;Product Only&quot; young professionals have started hitting the job market in the last 2-3 years.

PMs) and Product Managers who are Subject Matter Experts (SME PMs).</p> <p><img src="/sme_offended.PNG" alt="SME PM discuss Univ PM"> <em>SME PMs discuss Univ. PM on Reddit, Jan. 3rd 2023</em></p> <p>SME PMs have years or even decades of experience in the relevant field of their product and they have learned PM skills through certificates, books and blog posts. Univ. PMs have a deep knowledge of the PM processes and the reasons behind them, and they learn about the field of a specific product when joining the team.</p> <p>This made me wonder about what is more important <strong>for a product manager</strong>: Having subject matter expertise or having a wide array of methodologies available to discover the perfect product?</p> <p>In the next two sections, I will caricature the arguments I read in these debates and try to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a SME PM and an Univ. PM. Then I will try to be less caricatural in the third section.</p> <h2 id="the-sme-pm-is-intensely-focused-on-the-product"><a href="#the-sme-pm-is-intensely-focused-on-the-product" class="header-anchor">#</a> The SME PM is intensely focused on the product</h2> <p>After a successful career in diamond mining, manufacturing or reselling (for the sake of the story, but it could be any field of industry), the SME was given a chance to have a strong influence over the vision and strategy, have a bigger impact on his industry: they became a SME PM! They have an intimate knowledge and profound convictions of what to do to improve the product.</p> <p>The SME PM learns PM skills through certificates and reading blog posts, understands the main gist of it and starts working. They also have to learn their new position within the team. They may not use the full range of discovery technics and worse may be misusing some of them.</p> <p>Good results were achieved because the product team started discovery from a very good starting point, informed by all the subject matter expertise of the PM, coupled with a few key discovery iterations.</p> <h2 id="the-univ-pm-follows-the-product-processes"><a href="#the-univ-pm-follows-the-product-processes" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Univ. PM follows the product processes</h2> <p>After a year or two to complete a Master in Product Management (or just a few months to complete a certificate), the student has learned a lot of concepts and methods to help them frame their product vision, the discovery process, iterate quickly, and how to work as part of a product team.</p> <p>They learned about diamonds by talking with members of the product teams, with leadership and with clients. They rely on others to develop their own ideas about the product. They learned enough to be able to talk about their specific product but are not yet considered a thought leader or looked up to.</p> <p>Good results were achieved by testing a wide array of ideas and improving on the seemingly more successful ones.</p> <h2 id="product-management-is-a-lot-like-operational-research-optimization-problems"><a href="#product-management-is-a-lot-like-operational-research-optimization-problems" class="header-anchor">#</a> Product Management is a lot like Operational Research optimization problems</h2> <p>In a sense, &quot;building tech product that customers love&quot; (Marty Cagan's <em>Inspired</em> subtitle) is a lot like an optimization problem: we want to find the best (aka optimal) solution to a problem, we don't know how to find this optimal solution so our strategy is to start from somewhere and iterate to improve the market fit (optimization function).</p> <p>From this very gratuitous metaphore, we can look at the wiki page for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent#See_also" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradient descent<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> method to learn more. A parallel for product management is that, as product managers trying to find the best solution, we need to decide where to start our discovery, and decide where the next iteration will take us.</p> <p>Come back on our main discussion, it is will understood that a good SME PM has done their homework and has good PM skills, and similarly a good Univ. PM has done their homework and tried to become SME.</p> <p>It is also very important to always have this discussion in relation to an actual product. For AI-powered tools (like ChatGPT - I had to put this word somewhere in this article!), I absolutely think that the PM should also be a SME and a thought leader participating to write research paper, presenting at conferences etc. Whereas for products like Facebook, it seems that a Univ. PM would be perfect for the job!</p> <p>Product managers are never the caricatural versions I described here, and remembering this is a good way to have productive conversations with your fellow product managers who happen to have a different background and learn from them.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last updated:</span> <span class="time">4/8/2023, 2:28:46 PM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
